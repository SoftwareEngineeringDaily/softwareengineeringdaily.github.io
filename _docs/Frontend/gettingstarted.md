> *Npm run dev*

[View the site on localhost](http://localhost:8080)

To get started quickly, we recommend communicating with the [backend API instance hosted in Heroku](https://software-enginnering-daily-api.herokuapp.com/). Play around with it for awhile, then consider [setting up the backend locally](https://softwareengineeringdaily.github.io/Backend/gettingstarted/).

> To get used to the codebase, it might help to solve an [issue with the "good first issue" label](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-front-end/labels/good%20first%20issue)

### Style Guide
The [VueJS Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is a standard we try to maintain.

### Testing
>Pull requests must have some testing around them. Don’t be afraid to ask for help with writing tests!

#### End-to-end Browser Testing
We use [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted) to write end-to-end browser tests. Nightwatch is powered by Selenium, a common testing tool.
