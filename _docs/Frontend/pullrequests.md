### Submitting a Pull Request

When you submit a PR, please ask [Jason](https://github.com/jasonify) and [Jeff](https://github.com/crablar) to review it.

### Deployment

The web frontend is continuously deployed.

Once a pull request is accepted, it is pulled into the master branch, which builds in a Heroku staging environment called [sedaily-frontend-staging](https://sedaily-frontend-staging.herokuapp.com/).

After testing it manually, we promote it to our [Heroku production environment](https://sedaily.herokuapp.com/).
